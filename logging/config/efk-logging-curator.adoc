toc::[]

The Elasticsearch Curator tool performs scheduled maintenance operations
on a per-project basis. Curator performs actions daily based on its configuration.
Only one Curator Pod is recommended per Elasticsearch cluster.

The Cluster Logging Operator installs Curator and its configuration.
You can configure the Curator link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs[cron schedule] using the Cluster Logging Custom Resource and further
configuration options can be found in the Curator ConfigMap, `curator` in the `openshift-logging` project,
which incorporates the Curator configuration file, *_curator5.yaml_* and an {product-title} custom configuration file, *_config.yaml_*.

{product-title} uses the  *_config.yaml_* internally to generate the Curator link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/5.2/actionfile.html[`action` file].

Optionally, you can use the `action` file, directly. Editing this file allows you to use any action that Curator has available to it to be run periodically. However, this is only recommended for advanced users as modifying the file can be destructive to the cluster and can cause removal of required indices/settings from Elasticsearch. Most users only need to modify the Curator configuration map and never edit the `action` file.
