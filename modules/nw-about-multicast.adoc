= About multicast

With IP multicast, data is broadcast to many IP addresses simultaneously.

[IMPORTANT]
====
At this time, multicast is best used for low-bandwidth coordination or service
discovery and not a high-bandwidth solution.
====

Multicast traffic between {product-title} Pods is disabled by default. If you
are using the OpenShiftSDN network plug-in, you can enable multicast on a
per-project basis.

When using the OpenShiftSDN network plug-in:

* Multicast packets sent by a Pod will be delivered to all other Pods in the
project, regardless of `NetworkPolicy` objects. Pods may be able to communicate
over multicast even when they cannot communicate over unicast.
* Multicast packets sent by a Pod in one project will never be delivered to Pods
in any other project, even if there are `NetworkPolicy` objects allowing
communication between the projects.
