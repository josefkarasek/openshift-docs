<1> This provider name is prefixed to the GitHub numeric user ID to form an
identity name. It is also used to build the callback URL.
<2> Controls how mappings are established between this provider's identities and user objects.
<3> Optional: Reference to an {product-title} ConfigMap containing the
PEM-encoded certificate authority bundle to use in validating server
certificates for the configured URL. Only for use in GitHub Enterprise.
<4> The client ID of a
link:https://github.com/settings/applications/new[registered GitHub OAuth
application]. The application must be configured with a callback URL of
`<master>/oauth2callback/<identityProviderName>`.
<5> Reference to an {product-title} Secret containing the client secret
issued by GitHub.
<6> For GitHub Enterprise, you must provide the host name of your instance, such as
`example.com`. This value must match the GitHub Enterprise `hostname` value in
in the *_/setup/settings_* file and cannot include a port number. For GitHub,
omit this parameter.
<7> Optional list of organizations. If specified, only GitHub users that are members of
at least one of the listed organizations will be allowed to log in. If the GitHub OAuth
application configured in `clientID` is not owned by the organization, an organization

the first GitHub login by the organization's administrator, or from the GitHub organization settings.
Cannot be used in combination with the `teams` field.

the first GitHub login by the organization's administrator, or from the GitHub organization settings.
