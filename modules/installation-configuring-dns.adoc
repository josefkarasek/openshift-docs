= Configuring hosts to use DNS

Make sure each host in your environment is configured to resolve host names from
your DNS server. The configuration for hosts' DNS resolution depend on whether
DHCP is enabled. If DHCP is:

- Disabled, then configure your network interface to be static, and add DNS
nameservers to NetworkManager.

- Enabled, then the NetworkManager dispatch script automatically configures DNS
based on the DHCP configuration.

.Procedure

To verify that hosts can be resolved by your DNS server:

. Check the contents of *_/etc/resolv.conf_*:
+
----
$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
# Generated by NetworkManager
search example.com
nameserver 10.64.33.1
# nameserver updated by /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-origin-dns.sh
----
+
In this example, 10.64.33.1 is the address of our DNS server.

. Test that the DNS servers listed in *_/etc/resolv.conf_* are able to resolve
host names to the IP addresses of all masters and nodes in your {product-title}
environment:
+
----
$ dig <node_hostname> @<IP_address> +short
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ dig master.example.com @10.64.33.1 +short
10.64.33.100
$ dig node1.example.com @10.64.33.1 +short
10.64.33.101
----
