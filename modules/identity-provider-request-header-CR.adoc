----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to the user name in the request header to
form an identity name.
<2> Controls how mappings are established between this provider's identities and user objects.
<3> Optional: URL to redirect unauthenticated `/oauth/authorize` requests to,
that will authenticate browser-based clients and then proxy their request to
`\https://_<namespace_route>_/oauth/authorize`.
The URL that proxies to `\https://_<namespace_route>_/oauth/authorize` must end with `/authorize` (with no trailing slash),
and also proxy subpaths, in order for OAuth approval flows to work properly.
`${url}` is replaced with the current URL, escaped to be safe in a query parameter.
`${query}` is replaced with the current query string.
<4> Optional: URL to redirect unauthenticated `/oauth/authorize` requests to,
that will authenticate clients which expect `WWW-Authenticate` challenges, and
then proxy them to `\https://_<namespace_route>_/oauth/authorize`.
`${url}` is replaced with the current URL, escaped to be safe in a query parameter.
`${query}` is replaced with the current query string.
<5> Reference to an {product-title} ConfigMap containing a PEM-encoded
certificate bundle. Used as a trust anchor to validate the TLS
certificates presented by the remote server. If this file is not
present or valid the identity provider is not honored.
<6> Optional: list of common names (`cn`). If set, a valid client certificate with
a Common Name (`cn`) in the specified list must be presented before the request headers
are checked for user names. If empty, any Common Name is allowed. Can only be used in combination
with `clientCA`.
<7> Header names to check, in order, for the user identity. The first header containing
a value is used as the identity. Required, case-insensitive.
<8> Header names to check, in order, for an email address. The first header containing
a value is used as the email address. Optional, case-insensitive.
<9> Header names to check, in order, for a display name. The first header containing
a value is used as the display name. Optional, case-insensitive.
<10> Header names to check, in order, for a preferred user name, if different than the immutable
identity determined from the headers specified in `headers`. The first header containing
a value is used as the preferred user name when provisioning. Optional, case-insensitive.
