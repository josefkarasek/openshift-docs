= Creating the cluster

To create the {product-title} cluster, you provision machines by using the Ignition config
files that you generated with the installation program.

.Prerequisites

* Create the required infrastructure for the cluster.
* You obtained the installation program and generated the Ignition config files
for your cluster.
* You used the Ignition config files to create {op-system} machines for your
cluster.
* Your machines have internet access.


.Procedure

. Start and monitor the installation process:
+
----
$ openshift-install --dir <installation_directory> wait-for bootstrap-complete
INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for the Kubernetes API at https://api.test.example.com:6443...
INFO API v1.12.4+c53f462 up
INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for the bootstrap-complete event...
----
+
The command succeeds when the Kubernetes APIServer signals that it has been
bootstrapped on the control plane machines.

. After bootstrap process is complete, remove the bootstrap machine from the
load balancer.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must remove the bootstrap machine from the load balancer at this point.
====

. Confirm that the cluster recognizes the machines:
+
----
$ oc get nodes

NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
master-0  NotReady  master  50s  v1.12.4+c53f462
master-1  NotReady  master  63s  v1.12.4+c53f462
master-2  NotReady  master  64s  v1.12.4+c53f462
worker-0  NotReady  worker  76s  v1.12.4+c53f462
worker-1  NotReady  worker  70s  v1.12.4+c53f462
worker-2  NotReady  worker  69s   v1.12.4+c53f462
----
+
The output lists all of the machines that you created.

. Review the pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) and ensure that the
requests are for the machines that you added to the cluster:
+
----
$ oc get csr
----

. Approve the CSRs for your cluster machines. You can approve them individually
or, if all the CSRs are valid, approve them all by running the following
command:
+
----
$ oc get csr -ojson | jq -r '.items[] | select(.status == {} ) | .metadata.name' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
----
