= Debugging scaling or performance issues using the RHEL Tools container image

Red Hat distributes a `rhel-tools` container image, packaging tools that aid in
debugging scaling or performance problems. This container image:

* Allows users to deploy minimal footprint container hosts by moving packages out
of the base distribution and into this support container.

* Provides debugging capabilities for Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS, which has
an immutable package tree. `rhel-tools` includes utilities such as tcpdump, git,
gdb, perf, and many more common system administration utilities.

.Procedure

. To debug an issue, run:
+
----
# oc debug node/<node-ip-address>
----
+
For example:
+
----
# oc debug node/ip-10-0-171-215.us-west-2.compute.internal
Starting pod/ip-10-0-171-215us-west-2computeinternal-debug ...
----
+
This starts a tools pod on the node.
